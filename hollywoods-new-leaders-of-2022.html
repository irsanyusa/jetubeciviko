In addition to handling that roster, Brown, 34, helped construct companies for Dwyane Wade (59th & Prairie) and Misty Copeland (Life in Motion). With his former experience at Morgan Stanley, he also guided the media finance efforts for CAA’s TV department.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>Learn to listen:</strong> “[Being a good agent] really is listening,” says Brown. “Listening and understanding what the client’s needs are — centering on that first and foremost.

He was instrumental in driving multiple competitive spec sales, including sci-fi dramedy “Demascus,” by Tearrance Arvelle Chisholm, picked up to series by AMC, as well as thriller “The Watchful Eye,” by Julie Durk, picked up to series by Freeform/Hulu.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>Special creators:</strong> DeRemer, 36, is always on the lookout for fresh, diverse talent: “In the premium network and streamer space, new and emerging writers are continuing to benefit from the ‘voice-driven economy,’ as buyers are willing to invest in creators who offer a highly specific point of view, regardless of level of experience.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Kate Hurwitz</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Kate-Hurwitz-Kate-CROPPED-copy.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>Head of Management, Cinetic Media</strong> – Representation</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Hurwitz, 37, has distinguished her department as the go-to place for documentary filmmakers looking for management to help them navigate their careers. Her client Isabel Castro’s film “MIJA” sold to Disney+ and includes a deal negotiated by Hurwitz for narrative rights to FX for a series. Hurwitz was also a central part of the sale of Margaret Brown’s “Descendant” to Netflix. She has also worked with A-list documentarians including Lana Wilson, Petra Costa, Rachel Lears and Yance Ford.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>History now:</strong> “Working on ‘Descendant’ has been such a transformative experience over the past five years,” says Hurwitz. “This is a film that’s about the last slave ship to be brought over to America. It’s one of these films that makes it really clear that history is far from behind us.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Meghan Mackenzie</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Meghan-Mackenzie-Meghan-WME-copy.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>Partner, Non-Scripted TV, WME</strong> – Representation</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Knowing and respecting her clients’ fan bases has helped Mackenzie encourage industrious and entrepreneurial clients including Chrissy Teigen, Camila Cabello and Shay Mitchell branch into the unscripted space. She says selling Teigen’s docuseries (with Campfire and Nile Capello) “The Way Down: God, Greed, and the Cult of Gwen Shamblin” to HBO Max turned out to be a profound experience.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>Power of TV:</strong> “To see the effect of the show, occurring in real time, in the lives of real people, was simultaneously humbling and motivating,” says Mackenzie, 36. “Being involved in a television project that elicited so much catharsis for subjects and viewers alike has given greater meaning to my work.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Brad Pankosky</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Brad-Pankosky-Brad-Paradigm-copy.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>Talent Agent, Paradigm</strong> – Representation</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Pankosky, 33. started his career in Paradigm’s mailroom in 2013 and before long became an integral member of the talent department, having set Oscar lead actress contender Danielle Deadwyler to star in historical drama “Till.” He also works closely with Emmy-nominated and Golden Globe-winning “Succession” star Brian Cox, and comedic actor James Austin Johnson, whom he landed on “Saturday Night Live.” Other clients include Abby Elliott (“The Bear”) and Richard Cabral (“Mayans MC”).</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>All about storytelling: </strong>“While you can’t predict a hit, it’s important to protect your client to the fullest,” he says. “I’m excited to be an impactful person in a client’s life, helping them forge the path to tell compelling stories.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Marc Paskin</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Mark-Paskin-Mark-UTA-copy.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>Agent, News & Broadcasting, UTA</strong> – Representation</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Paskin’s collaboration with agency vice chairman Jay Sures has yielded such deals as Jen Psaki’s new role at MSNBC, where she’ll host a streaming show next year; Jenna Bush Hager’s NBC deal, with a first-look arrangement for her production company; and Janai Norman’s promotion to co-anchor of ABC’s “Weekend GMA.” Paskin, 36, also helped close a hosting deal for Baratunde Thurston with Lenovo’s “Late Night I.T.,” and negotiated Beverly Chase’s promotion at Vice News to VP, Current Programming & Development.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>The news it is a-changin’:</strong> “Business models supporting the digital news ecosystem are evolving in dynamic ways,” Paskin says. “As these new platforms continue to expand, industry change-makers will be inspired and empowered to reimagine how to reach the next generation of news consumers.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>J.R.

Ringer, a newcomer at the agency, recently got Oscar-winning “CODA” actor Troy Kotsur cast in a Dis- ney+ project and is helping him develop a movie idea. Hammad’s mission is turning her own experiences as a woman of color into an advantage for her clients, many of whom are women or from underrepresented communities. She closed deals positioning Amy Rardin as head writer for Marvel’s “Echo” and Sara Hess as an EP on “House of the Dragon.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>Being heard: </strong>Verve’s commitment to diversity and inclusivity is more than PR spin, say the agents. “If you don’t give a voice to those from a different background than the majority, diversity is meaningless,” Hammad says. “This agency has been committed to listening to opinions from everyone who has something to say, be it an assistant or the lower-level agent. It’s not just having a seat at the table. It’s making sure everybody’s voice is heard at that table.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Christian Rodriguez</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Christian-Rodriguez-Christian-AAO-Ent-UseThisOne-copy.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>Founder, Literary Manager, AAO Entertainment</strong> – Representation</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Upon founding AAO in 2017, Rodriguez, now 36, focused on building a literary management company that helps unique voices be heard in Hollywood.

His activism includes advocating for a change in dressing room language in New York theatre spaces and opening up discussions about creating safe on-set workspaces. His clients include actors Nyomi Stewart and M.

A manager at Hollywood power broker LBI Entertainment , Warren looks after some of the most exciting and original voices in the industry. His client Andy Siara wrote the Sundance sales record-setter “Palm Springs” — and followed it up with the biggest series in the history of streamer Peacock, “The Resort.” His roster also includes: the Firpos, the cousin scribes of Marvel’s “Eternals,” who will next tackle a series reimagining of Butch & Sundance led by Rege Jean-Page and Glenn Powell; and Julie Anne Robinson, who directed the pilot of Netflix’s ”Bridgerton” and the recent smash “Partner Track.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>Boss approval:</strong> Warren is “an exceptional advocate for our clients, and critical to our future growth,” says LBI partner Scott Greenberg.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Roberto Alcantara, Allie Wasserman</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Roberto-Alcantara-Allie-Wasserman.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>Alcantara: Senior VP, Drama Programming, HBO MAX</strong> – Film & TV</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>Wasserman: VP, Comedy Programming, HBO</strong> – Film & TV</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The jobs of Wasserman, 31, and Alcantara, 40, are opposite sides of the same coin, not only because one focuses on comedy programming and the other on drama, but also because they work for two distinct entities: Wasserman for HBO and Alcantara for HBO Max. What they do have in common is a sharp eye for identifying talent and working with creators to develop and high-quality programming fitting their respective brands. Wasserman says it’s surreal to work with the creators of such iconic HBO comedies as “Barry” and “I May Destroy You,” as well as upcoming comedy series “Rain Dogs,” and Sam Mendes and Armando Iannucci’s “The Franchise.” Meanwhile, Alcantara develops and produces HBO Max’s tentpole dramas including “The Girls on the Bus,” “Warrior,” “Raised by Wolves” and “Full Circle.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>Bringing series to life: </strong>“From Ridley Scott to Steven Soderbergh, I’ve had the honor of working with filmmakers I’ve admired for as long as I can remember, and on epic projects,” Alcantara says. “My focus tends to be on bringing big IP-driven series to life for the HBO Max platform’s diverse array of programming, which of course includes HBO’s distinctive and groundbreaking scripted series and documentaries.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Melody Dai</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Melody-Dai-Melody-copy.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>Senior VP, Global Marketing & Data Strategy Universal Pictures</strong> – Film & TV</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Jurassic World: Dominion,” “Minions” and “Nope” are three noteworthy projects that Dai, 37, worked on in her role at Universal, applying a new data-driven approach and strategy for film marketing in an environment of rapidly shifting windows.
