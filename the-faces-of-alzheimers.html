This was one of those times for me. Maureen was so committed to defeating the scourge of Alzheimer’s, to getting more funding for research and increasing understanding of the disease that she sometimes delayed her own treatment for the melanoma that eventually killed her.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Maureen would have tirelessly done interviews on Aug. 9; instead, her husband Dennis Revell spoke to the media, as did the actor David Hyde Pierce, who lost both his grandfather and his father to Alzheimer’s. My mother released a statement. Maureen’s voice had been silenced, but her activism, her determination, were still present.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">We learn about diseases through the faces of those who are stricken. Famous faces garner the most attention, obviously. When we think of Alzheimer’s, my father’s face comes to mind. Or Iris Murdoch’s. And now Heston’s. When Parkinson’s is mentioned, we picture Michael J. Fox or Muhammad Ali.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But there is another way that faces tell the story. You have to lean closer, look carefully into the eyes, study the set of the jaw and the tilt of the head. I recognized more than the famous visage of Heston when I saw his taped announcement. I saw the first shallow waves of a cruel disease lapping at the edges of the person he has always known himself to be. I recognized it because I saw the same look in my father’s eyes eight years ago.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In the early stages of Alzheimer’s, the eyes have a wariness, a veil of fear. It’s as if the person is standing at the edge of a fogbank, knowing that in time it will engulf him and there is no chance of outrunning it. I used to see my father’s eyes simultaneously plead and hold firm. It would happen when a sentence broke off because he couldn’t remember how to finish it. Or when he would say, “I have this condition–I keep forgetting things.” He was on a high wire, balancing on courage, with the dark waters of fear below, and he was using every bit of his strength to cling to that wire.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Slowly–sometimes over months, sometimes over years–the eyes stop pleading. There is a resignation, an acceptance of distance, strangeness, a life far from home. You know the look when you see it, and the only mercy is that fear seems to have subsided.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The eyes of family members change too. My brother Ron’s eyes show the sweet stoicism that men seem born to possess. But looking more intently, I see the bubble of pain beneath the surface. A father’s helplessness has to tear at the fibers of a son’s heart like a dull blade. My own eyes have too much history in them, I often think. I was the little girl who worshipped her father, and the young woman who hurt him the way daughters do when their love is needy and true. Now I look at him in a soft, maternal way, which still feels odd to me, even after all these years. As if the laws of nature have been turned upside down. My mother’s eyes are frequently such deep wells, I have to look away. A 50-year marriage is full of intimate memories that live in the blood of lovers and life partners–memories that are both benediction and punishment. So much life has been shared, and so much has been lost.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">I could tell you that I don’t fear getting the disease myself because I know how toxic fear is, how paralyzing. But in the next breath I would have to tell you that there are late hours of the night when I lie awake and wonder what fate has in store for me.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">At other times, I study photographs of my father from many years ago, or film clips. I don’t want to forget how his eyes used to look. Alzheimer’s teaches a harsh lesson–that the past is like the rudder of a ship. It keeps you moving through the present, steers you into the future. Without it, without memory, you are unmoored, a wind-tossed boat with no anchor. You learn this by watching someone you love drift away.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">I woke last night and listened to the silence. It was a late, deep hour, long after midnight, long before dawn. I thought about how, for someone with Alzheimer’s, silence must be like a prison, another corner of the wasteland. There can be nothing soothing or serene about it.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Perhaps the next time members of Congress assemble to decide how much money to set aside for Alzheimer’s research, they should be asked to listen to silence differently, as if it were a jail sentence. Maybe then they would look into their hearts and know that if stopping a disease that is stalking so many is not a top priority, we have lost our collective heart as a nation.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmaaqpOdtrexjm9tb29ga4BwwMeeZJ%2BZk5rAbrvFZpilspiatq6x0axm</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./crepole-maurienne-un-concours-pour-attirer-les-entreprises-73.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="un concours pour attirer les entreprises (73)">&larr;
