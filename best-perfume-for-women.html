With an overwhelming array of perfumes, fragrances, and other scent-based products available, finding that perfect match can be a challenge any time of the year.</p><p>To help you navigate this fragrant world, I embarked on an extensive research journey. This included conducting smell tests, gathering opinions from friends and colleagues, and poring over hundreds of reviews for perfumes and eau de toilettes. After compiling a shortlist, I took it a step further by testing these scents in-person and diving deeper into customer feedback. While I aimed to focus primarily on true perfumes, my curated list also includes some eau de toilette and cologne options, with a few fragrances recognized as unisex by their creators.</p><h2 id=our-top-picks-for-the-best-perfumes-for-women>Our top picks for the best perfumes for women</h2><h3>Best long-lasting perfume for women: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Le Labo Santal 33 Eau De Parfum</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best long-lasting perfume for women</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Le Labo Santal 33 Eau de Parfum at Nordstrom, Size 3.4 Oz</h3></p><p>Many perfumes are designed to last all day into night, but most scents will fade after seven to nine hours. While I can’t guarantee it because factors like sweat may impact the life of your first spray, this Le Labo Santal 33 Eau De Parfum is a notably (according to reviews) lasting fragrance that won’t let you down. Described as the “spirit of the American West,” this perfume is a unisex scent with notes of cardamom, violet and iris, sandalwood, and leather, among others.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Size: 3.4 ounces</li><li>Notes: Top: Violet accord, cardamom; middle: iris, ambrox; and base: cedarwood, leather, sandalwood.</li><li>Price on publish: $322</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Can be worn by anyone, not just women</li><li>Long-standing scent</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>It is very expensive</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>A long-lasting fragrance with a woodsy base that may appeal to men and women alike.</p><h3>Best vanilla perfume for women: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Ellis Brooklyn Vanilla Milk</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best vanilla perfume for women</span></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sephora.com/productimages/sku/s2619815-main-zoom.jpg alt="Ellis Brooklyn VANILLA MILK Eau de Parfum 1.7 oz / 50 mL eau de parfum spray" title="Ellis Brooklyn VANILLA MILK Eau de Parfum 1.7 oz / 50 mL eau de parfum spray" width=256 height=160 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><h3 class=title>Ellis Brooklyn VANILLA MILK Eau de Parfum 1.7 oz / 50 mL eau de parfum spray</h3></p><p>Founder Bee Shapiro created the Ellis Brooklyn line of cruelty-free and vegan fragrances known for its complex scents from 9 different fragrance families described as citrus, aquatic, and woods, among others. Vanilla Milk wins our choice for the best vanilla fragrance that’s warm and sweet but not too cloying, which occurs with some vanilla scents.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Size: 1.7 ounces</li><li>Notes: Top: Dark rum, davanal; mid: honey (vegan), bran absolute, cinnamon; base: sandalwood, vanilla bean, and cocoa absolute.</li><li>Price on publish: $108</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Sweet scent and we love Ellis Brooklyn’s long list of fragrances</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>May be too sweet for some folks</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>Dark rum, sandalwood, and vanilla bean are just some of the warm notes in this vegan perfume.</p><h3>Best musk perfume for women: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Heretic Florgasm</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best musk perfume for women</span></p><p><h3 class=title>HERETIC Florgasm Eau de Parfum</h3></p><p>The original musk scent probably isn’t something you want to wear (hint: it came from the sex glands of a Tibetan musk deer, now a protected species), but today, many of these earthy, sensual scents capture smells like dark green woods or rich spices with exotic floral undertones. I love Heretic Florgasm because it smells like crushed flowers and damp leaves—like a walk in a forest after a rainstorm when everything is damp and heavy with botanicals.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Size: 1.7 ounces</li><li>Notes: Top: Coriander, bergamot, bitter orange, pink pepper, lemon, and pimento berry; middle: jasmine, linden blossom, orange blossom, ylang-ylang, and tuberose; base: hibiscus seed</li><li>Price on publish: $165</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>The orange blossom notes</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>High price</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>If you love a spicy and exotic botanical perfume and don’t mind the higher price tag, this one is for you</p><h3>Best sweet perfume for women: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Kensie So Pretty</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best sweet perfume for women</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Kensie So Pretty by Kensie 3.4 oz Eau De Parfum Spray for Women</h3></p><p>Sweet but not cloying, Kensie So Pretty is a lightweight, sweet perfume that doesn’t overpower. Some users say they catch a whiff of vanilla, but this perfume is built on fruity flavors like apples, bergamot, and tangerine. The bottom fragrance notes are white cedar and musk that help balance out the sweetness.</p><h4>Specifications</h4><ul><li>Size: 3.4 ounces</li><li>Notes: Top Fragrance Notes: Bergamot, Pink Lady apple, tangerine, and anise; middle fragrance notes: Iris and green florals; bottom fragrance notes: musk and white cedar.</li><li>Price on publish: $55</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>It’s affordability and fruity scent</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>It may not be sophisticated enough for musk lovers</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>Cedar and musk help balance this out the vanilla and apple top notes in this affordable perfume.</p><h3>Best summer perfume for women: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Carter+Jane Surfer Girl</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best summer perfume for women</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Carter+Jane Surfer Girl</h3></p><p>The essence of summer by the sea and in the surf can be obtained in a bottle. While you won’t find saltwater in the ingredients, it smells like wild grasses or beach flowers in the sand and reviewers say it smells like the shore. If you want to be a surfer girl, but can’t get to the beach, try this summery scent and let your imagination do the rest.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Size: 1.7 ounces</li><li>Notes: Top notes: Blue tansy and lemongrass; middle notes: honeysuckle and bergamot; base notes: rosewood</li><li>Price on publish: $28 for the roll-on</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Affordable and smells like the beach</li><li>The roll-on option</li><li>Eco-friendly</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>Scent is on the lighter side</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>If you want an affordable roll-on perfume that smells like the beach, this should be on your list.</p><h3>Best perfume for young women: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Dossier Gourmand White Flowers</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best perfume for young women</span></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dossier.co/cdn/shop/files/dossier-gourmand-white-flowers.jpg alt="Dossier Gourmand White Flowers" title="Dossier Gourmand White Flowers" width=256 height=160 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><h3 class=title>Dossier Gourmand White Flowers</h3></p><p>They say imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, and this affordable, best-selling perfume by Dossier was created with this adage in mind. It was inspired by the best-selling scent, Flowerbomb by Viktor & Rolf. While many teens (and adults) can’t afford its price tag (over $100), they can indulge in a similar explosion of scent for under $30. And if you don’t think it comes close enough to the original, all returns are free.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Size: 50 milliliters</li><li>Notes: Top: Bergamot, green tea, freesia, and berries; middle: white flowers, orchid and rose; base: musk, patchouli, caramel, and vanilla.</li><li>Price on publish: $29</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Affordable but smells expensive</li><li>Returns are free</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>Some reviewers say it doesn’t come close to Flowerbomb</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>For teens who love the popular Flowerbomb but can’t afford it, this is a similar scent for under $30.</p><h3>Best perfume for mature women: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Henry Rose Queens and Monsters</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best perfume for mature women</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Queens & Monsters - 8ML TRAVEL SPRAY</h3></p><p>This perfume is made to be worn by men or women. I chose it for mature women because it’s sophisticated with musk and woodsy base notes that balance the sweet freesia and jasmine in the middle ones. It’s also EWG-verified and Cradle to Cradle certified, which means the ingredients in this perfume “meet the strictest standards of health, safety, and transparency known today,” making it a smart choice for mature and sensitive skin. Plus, you can share it with your partner—it’s made for everyone.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Size: 50 milliliters</li><li>Notes: Top: Violet leaf, neroli and petitgrain; middle: freesia and jasmine; base: vanilla, coco musk and sandalwood</li><li>Price on publish: $120</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Eco-friendly and safe for all skin types</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>Scent is on the “sweeter” side</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>An eco-friendly clean perfume with musk and woodsy base notes that won’t irritate sensitive skin.</p><h3>Best floral perfume for women: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Jo Malone London Basil and Neroli Cologne</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best floral perfume for women</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Jo Malone London™ Basil & Neroli Cologne at Nordstrom, Size 3.4 Oz</h3></p><p>This perfume is like smelling a late spring garden with top notes of aromatic basil rounded off with neroli smelling of bitter orange blossoms. While there are more floral perfumes full of roses and gardenias, I love this one for its fresh, clean scent. Some reviewers say it doesn’t last as long as other perfumes, but that’s because it is a cologne, which unlike a perfume (which has more oils), doesn’t hold its scent for long periods. And it’s expensive, so if you are on a budget, I recommend skipping this perfume. Shopping tip: Jo Malone’s Wood Sage Sea Salt scent made our list of the <a rel=alternate href=#>best colognes for men</a>.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Size: 3.4 ounces</li><li>Notes: Top: Basil grand vert; middle: neroli; base: white musk</li><li>Price on publish: $165</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Simple list of ingredients</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>The scent doesn’t hold as long as a perfume</li><li>Expensive</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>This Jo Malone cologne may not last as long as a traditional perfume, but it smells like an English garden after the rain</p><h3>Best fruity perfume for women: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Replica Under the Lemon Trees</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best fruity perfume for women</span></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sephora.com/productimages/sku/s2415610-main-zoom.jpg alt="Maison Margiela 'REPLICA' Under the Lemon Trees 1 oz/ 30 mL" title="Maison Margiela 'REPLICA' Under the Lemon Trees 1 oz/ 30 mL" width=256 height=160 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><h3 class=title>Maison Margiela 'REPLICA' Under the Lemon Trees 1 oz/ 30 mL</h3></p><p>If you dream of strolling among the lemon trees in Sicily, this fruity perfume may be your new favorite. A nice departure if you want a break from grapefruit and lime notes (equally nice) often found in fruity perfume. Under the lemon trees is not overpowering in its citrus scent, making it a good everyday, lightweight</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Size: 3.4 ounces</li><li>Notes: Top: Lime, petitgrain and cardamom; middle: green tea, mate and coriander; base: white musk, cedar and Rock rose.</li><li>Price on publish: $160</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Smells like lemons (even though it is made from lime)</li><li>Good everyday scent</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>If you don’t like the smell of citrus, skip it</li><li>Expensive</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>Great for everyday wear if you love citrus scents, but it doesn’t come cheap.</p><h3>Best everyday perfume for women: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Philosophy Amazing Grace Eau de Toilette</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best everyday perfume for women</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Philosophy Amazing Grace Spray Fragrance - 4.0 oz - Philosophy Amazing Grace Perfume and Fragrance</h3></p><p>Amazing Grace is a popular daily perfume for women who like a subtle, long-lasting floral scent with bergamot, lily of the valley, and musk. One reviewer said: “It smells like you're having your best day ever, and then you found money on the sidewalk.” It’s hard to beat that description, but we also found it a wonderful perfume to layer with other scents or wear independently. And if you love the scent, it also comes in a three-in-one bubble bath, shower gel and shampoo, plus a scented firming body cream.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Size: 2.0 ounces (comes in three sizes: .05, 2.0, and 4.0 ounces)</li><li>Notes: Top: Bergamot; middle: muguet blossoms; base: lasting musk</li><li>Price on publish: $60</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Affordable and comes in three sizes</li><li>Lightweight scent</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>May not last as long all day</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>Affordable perfume that works well alone or layered with other scents.</p><h3>Best designer perfume for women: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Gucci Bloom</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best designer perfume for women</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Gucci Bloom Eau de Parfum</h3></p><p>An affordable designer perfume that smells like a garden, Gucci Bloom offers all of this and more. Natural tuberose and jasmine scents create a lightweight white floral scent on the skin, but doesn’t lack staying power. One reviewer said it is a recent revolving standard in her perfume rotation because of its flowery scent, which can be worn day or night.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Size: 1.6 ounces</li><li>Notes: Top: Jasmine; middle: tuberose; base not: Rangoon creeper (a vine and flower native to tropical Asia)</li><li>Price on publish: $123</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>It’s a versatile day-to-night scent</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>May be too floral for some wearers</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>A versatile scent that works for day or night; if you love white florals, this one is for you.</p><h3>Best luxury perfume for women: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Frédéric Malle Synthetic Jungle by Annie Flippo</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best luxury perfume for women</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Frédéric Malle Synthetic Jungle by Annie Flippo</h3></p><p>A fashionable friend told me once that perfumes by Frédéric Malle are all she ever wears, and there are a lot to choose from. Visit his website to find your new favorite scent based on creations and mood. You can also find an olfactive map to help you understand the different compositions of his collection of perfumes created by a variety of perfumers. I love Synthetic Jungle's nod to scents like patchouli and black current. If you want to get your Daisy Jones and the Six vibes on, this scented homage to the ‘70s is the perfect (perfume) accessory.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Size: 50 milliliters</li><li>Notes: Top: Lily of the valley; middle: jasmine; base: patchouli</li><li>Price on publish: $225</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>The simple ingredients that deliver a subtle, sultry smell</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>It is extremely expensive</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>Extremely expensive but expertly crafted perfume with simple ingredients, like jasmine and patchouli.</p><h3>Best mini perfume set for women: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Snif’s mini bestseller bundle</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best mini perfume set for women</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Snif’s mini bestseller bundle</h3></p><p>This adorable bundle of three bestsellers from scent-master Snif (Tart Deco, Sweet Ash, and Way With Woods) is a great way to introduce new scents to yourself (or the one you love). These genderless scents are small enough to get through security at the airport or tuck into your smallest clutch when you head out for the night. All of Snif’s products are vegan and meet industry clean standards, without parabens, preservatives, or synthetic dyes.

Looking at the notes on a bottle can help you decide whether you want to try it, but smelling it yourself is usually the best way to decide. Buying a perfume for a special occasion or a loved one as a gift on Valentine’s Day is a way to show intimacy and love because scents are so personal and smells are linked to memory.</p><ul><li><strong>Top note:</strong> This is the first smell that hits you when you open a bottle of perfume and take a whiff. These notes last the least amount of time.</li><li><strong>Middle note:</strong> This is the main body of the perfume, and you can usually smell it after your senses take in the initial scent.</li><li><strong>Base note:</strong> Base notes are the smells that stick around for hours. Musk, sandalwood, or other heavier scents will often live in a perfume’s base notes.</li></ul><h2 id=how-to-pick-a-perfume>How to pick a perfume</h2><p>When picking a perfume, what you smell when you open the bottle may smell different to your friend. Your sense of smell is processed by the <a rel=nofollow href=#>brain’s areas also used to process memories and emotions</a>. This means when you open a bottle of perfume and inhale the honeysuckle that reminds you of your childhood garden, you may gravitate toward it over one that smells of violets. And to make matters more complicated, according to <a rel=nofollow href=#>research from Duke University</a>, it’s common for people to experience smells, like perfume, spices, or foods, differently.</p><p>When you shop for perfume, make sure to smell it in a few different ways, in the bottle, on a test strip, and via a sample, ideally outside the store, to determine if you like the scent. This is important because shops that carry perfume often have many smells floating around in the air, making it difficult to pinpoint what your particular scent actually smells like.</p><p>Now that I have told you perfumes may smell slightly differently to (and on) everyone, we have created a list of popular scents with very different notes to help you find your new favorite fragrance.</p><h2 id=frequently-asked-questions-faqs>Frequently asked questions (FAQs)</h2><h3>What is the right way to use perfume?</h3><p><a rel=alternate href=#>How you apply cologne</a> or perfume depends on your personal preferences, but most perfumers will say you should use perfume on your pressure points, wrists, behind the ears, and neck. Some people like to put perfume between their breasts, as well.</p><h3>What is the best-smelling perfume that people will like?</h3><p>It is impossible to know how someone will react (romantically or otherwise) to your perfume. One may love the smell of cut green grass and flowers; others are attracted to a dark, musk scent. Wear whatever perfume makes you happy. If you are looking for a universal favorite scent, vanilla is often a top contender.</p><h3>Which perfumes are suitable for everyday wear?</h3><p>Scent is personal, so what you want to wear daily is subjective. Perfumes made from natural essences with lightweight scents may be better than heavy musk for a daytime office or school setting.</p><h3>How do I choose the right perfume that suits my personality?</h3><p>Shopping for a fragrance is a little trickier than, say, shopping for the <a rel=alternate href=#>best eyeshadow palette</a>—since you’re matching your own mood or personality instead of choosing something that works with your undertones. Some perfumers recommend perfumes <a rel=nofollow href=#>based on the elements</a>: air, earth, water, and fire, with scents dedicated to one or the other. Think about what smells you like out in the world. For example, a scent with rich jasmine or gardenia notes might be a good fit if you love rich floral gardens. An earthy scent with moss or sandalwood notes could be a good fit if the forest calls your name. Some shops let you “create” your own perfume, like <a rel=nofollow href=#>Olfactory NYC</a>, where scentologists can help you create a signature fragrance.</p><h3>What is the difference between eau de toilette and eau de parfum?</h3><p>While it may vary from perfumer, overall, eau de parfum usually has a percentage of essences between 10 and 15%. Still, eau de toilette (the least concentrated scent) usually only has 8 to 10% of essences. Perfume or eau de parfum usually lasts the longest of all the scents.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmasoJ%2Blvaq6xmiYq6yZmLmme8Geqq1loJq%2Fp8HMnmSfp6JixLC5xKdm</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./bob-wooler-1117860663.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Bob Wooler">&larr;
