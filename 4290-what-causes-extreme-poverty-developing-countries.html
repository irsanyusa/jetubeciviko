Though <a href=#>academic research</a> has shown that there has been a general <b>reduction in extreme levels of poverty in developing countries across the globe, serious problems remain.</b> A large section of the world’s<a href=#> poor</a> are still left without the <b>basic necessities of life,</b> are malnourished and destitute.</p><h2>We asked Labs participants how they <b>defined poverty and</b> what they believed were the <b>causes of extreme levels of poverty in developing countries</b>, in deprived<b> regions such as sub-Saharan Africa.</b></h2><h2><b></b><b><span>What is Poverty?</span></b></h2><p>Labs participants gave numerous definitions of <b>what they perceived poverty</b> to be. The majority of participants said that <b>poverty comes in different forms,</b> with most participants referring to <b>relative </b>and <b>absolute or extreme levels of poverty.</b></p><p>Most stated that poverty in the United Kingdom was<b> relative.</b></p><ul><li>Some participants saw <b>relative poverty </b>where people <b>had little or no money</b> and had been <b>living off benefits, or had been unemployed for a considerable period.</b> Participants also stated that the <b>poverty in the United Kingdom</b> was increasing, and consisted of <b>families as well as individuals</b> falling into the poverty trap.</li><li>In addition, other participants said that different areas in the United Kingdom had <b>differing levels of poverty, and that poverty has to be classified according to a case by case model, rather than a universal model.</b></li><li>In contrast, the <b>majority of participants</b> said that <b>extreme levels of poverty were far worse</b> than the poverty seen in <b>developed countries such as the United Kingdom. </b>Most noted that<b> extreme levels of poverty were where people faced a daily struggle just to survive, as these people lacked basic needs, </b>such as water, food, and shelter.</li><li>Many participants noted that<b> the poverty experienced in the United Kingdom and in developed countries</b> is different to the <b>poverty experienced in developing countries.</b></li></ul><h2><b></b><b><span>Causes of extreme poverty</span></b></h2><p>Participants outlined different causes as to why<b> extreme levels of poverty exist in </b>regions such as sub-Saharan Africa. Participants were <b>largely divided in their opinions</b></p><h3><b><span>Political regime & dictatorships:</span></b></h3><p>A large number of participants remarked that the<b> political regimes in regions such as sub-Saharan Africa had caused extreme levels of poverty to exist.</b> Most participants in this group outlined that much of the <b>economic wealth was in the hands of a dictatorship,</b> rather than being dispersed out to the people.</p><p>Participants also noted that these <b>political regimes</b> were <b>highly corrupt and </b>had economic programmes which did not create growth, but instead made the<b> rich richer </b>and the <b>poor poorer</b> in society. These reasons, plus a <b>lack of development</b> <strong>and accessible education</strong> was perceived as a root cause.</p><h3><b><span>Western Countries & The Global Order:<br></span></b></h3><p>A large section of participants suggested that rich western countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom are to blame for the <b>plight of the poor in destitute countries. </b>Participants <b>cite the colonization period,</b> using examples such as <b>Nigeria </b>and <b>Zimbabwe</b> where colonialism had exploited these countries and led to <b>tribal divisions, religious conflict, and Civil wars.</b></p><p>Similarly, participants also remarked that under the colonial period,<b> valuable resources </b>such as diamonds and oil<b> were taken from these countries and given to rich Western countries, </b>which have arguably<b> caused long-term poverty in sub-Saharan Africa.</b></p><p>A minority noted that <strong>the</strong><b> current global order is to blame</b>, with certain dominant global powers and international organizations such as<b> the World Trade Organization </b>and<b> the International Monetary Fund not doing enough to help the plight of the poor </b>in impoverished countries<b>. </b>On the other hand though, some participants questioned the effect of international aid and outlined its <b>limitations.</b></p><h3><b><span>Physical geography & disease:</span></b></h3><p>Participants in this group noted that <b>widespread famines and lack of healthcare</b> in poor developing countries were to blame.</p><p>Participants discussed factors such as the lack of crops in poorer countries, which made it virtually impossible to produce food, in effect <b>leading to starvation and an increase of famines.</b> Other participants in this group recognised that <b>geography played a part,</b> with some countries <b>landlocked and without a natural water source</b>, more prone to <b>famines and droughts.</b></p><h2>What causes poverty</h2><p><b>(Click on the titles below to read the views of Labs participants)</b></p><h2><strong>Viewpoint 1- Political regime & dictatorships</strong><br><strong></strong></h2><p>“Exploitation of <b>resources by bodies which do not place sufficiently high importance</b> on the source of their wealth. These bodies may be internal to the areas suffering from poverty, where a dictator appropriates <b>resources or from external sources such as western society”<i> </i></b><i>Anon</i></p><p>“Having visited Africa many times, the problems are<b> corruption</b>, <b>tribalism</b> and a lack of <b>basic education” </b><i>SY, Yorkshire</i></p><p>“Africa has poverty from the last thirty years. <b>About 1.4 billion live in poverty</b>; they don't have food, shelter, sanitation and water so on. Main reasons are <b>lack of education and low GDP</b>, limited <b>resources</b>” <i>Saba, London</i></p><p>“Over population in some areas, but <b>greed and corruption</b> is the greatest cause. <b>India can afford</b> Nuclear weapons and a Space Programme for example but seems unwilling or unable to<b> look after huge numbers of its population</b>. How can countries such as this <b>have thousands of children left to fend for themselves on the streets whilst the ruling classes live in luxury</b>?” <i>Simon, North Cornwall</i></p><p>“<b>Lack of education</b> is the main cause - the people have <b>no way to get out of the situation.</b> Coupled with a lack of facilities (some have no water or electricity), <b>lack of investment by their governments, corruption of the governments, and lack of social services” </b><i>Anon</i></p><p><b>“A lack on infrastructure to allow the combatting of poverty (such as education, medicine and farming), normally caused by political turmoil, corruption or natural disasters” </b><i>Anon</i></p><h2><strong>Viewpoint 2 - Western Countries & The Global Order</strong></h2><p>“<b>Legacy of colonialism and exploitation.</b> These nations <b>never developed</b> industrially in a normal way, and now the mega-corporations that run the world dictate the terms of trade, so <b>the poor nations can't get out of the pit they're in. The solution has to be fair trade”</b><i> Anon</i></p><p>“There are many and varied causes of poverty in Africa. <b>Civil wars, corruption, rampant nepotism and mismanagement.</b> Imposition of unfair and damaging policies by the <b>IMF and World Bank,</b> through the nineties. Lack of <b>social welfare and social policies</b> in general that would be helpful to the <b>population in general</b>“ <i>Brian</i></p><p>“Africa’s absolute poverty comes from the inequality of the way it is shared out! Not everyone in the <b>World can be disgustingly rich.</b> In Africa it is the western <b>world that has stolen the resources</b> and they are not in an <b>unending supply</b>!” <i>Carl, Devon</i></p><p>“Trade barriers prevent <b>them trading their goods</b> with the west” <i>Anon</i></p><p>“Capitalism. The system that we live under will always lead to <b>oppression, exploitation, poverty and death </b>for the <b>majority of people in</b> the world” <i>Anon</i></p><h2><strong>Viewpoint 3 - Physical geography & disease</strong></h2><p>“Lack of birth <b>control</b>, <b>disease,</b> lack of <b>clean water</b>” Anon</p><p>“I believe <b>‘poverty’ </b>is <b>different</b> in developing countries. This is because <b>they are more likely to suffer</b> from the following issues <b>whereas developed countries often will not</b> - famine, access to sanitation and <b>clean water, war, illnesses such as TB, cholera, HIV/AIDS”</b> <i>Anon</i></p><p>“Drought, famine, <b>lack of clean water, lack of hygienic living conditions</b>” <i>David, Cambridge</i></p><p>"Famine due to <b><i>crop failure and despots</i> who prevent their populace</b> from getting all the aid sent by more affluent countries" <i>Anon</i></p><h2><b>What's your view?</b><b><b><span> Are there any other factors which you think could cause developing countries to have high levels of extreme poverty?</span></b></b></h2><h2><b><span>Add your voice to the debate in Disqus below</span></b></h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmixn6q0sMKNnKZnrZtkvbC4yK2gnKtflr%2B1tcKlnKxnZGeGcXnWoZitZZOWwrSx0macsayimrqmec%2BorZ6qpK56pbHVnqOoqJmjtG6vzq6lraqZmsA%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./winning-the-internet-7-charlie-sheen-memes-weve-been-expecting.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Winning the Internet: 7 Charlie Sheen Memes Weve Been Expecting">&larr;
