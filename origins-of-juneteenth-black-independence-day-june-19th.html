Though it’s been celebrated by Black Americans as early as in the mid-late 1800s, Juneteenth is a date that was long omitted from history books—and wasn’t designated as a federal holiday until 2021, after police killings of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and other Black people in the U.S. renewed a push for conversations on racial justice and the holiday’s enshrinement on a national level.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“It recognizes liberation, it recognizes freedom. Some people will refer to it as Black Independence Day. It’s a day to celebrate the ending of an era of 246 years of enslavement that African Americans experienced in this country,” says Daina Ramey Berry, Professor of History and Dean of Humanities and Fine Arts at the University of California, Santa Barbara.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Many Americans might not know why the date is significant or even celebrated, since many might not have learned about the event in school. “Many people assume that freedom began with the Emancipation Proclamation and think of Lincoln as the great liberator,” says Berry.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But the real history is more complicated than that. On January 1, 1863, President Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation, <a href=#>declaring</a> that "all persons held as slaves" in the Confederacy or states that seceded from the Union, "are, and henceforward shall be free." But that freedom did not come immediately, as the Civil War continued on and Union soldiers went from state to state to enforce the measure. “Essentially, very few enslaved people were freed in 1863,” says Berry.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">On June 19th, 1865, two and a half years after the Emancipation Proclamation was issued and two months after the Civil War officially ended, Union Army General Gordon Granger and 2,000 of his soldiers arrived in Galveston, Texas, to inform enslaved people of their freedom.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“When the Union army reached Galveston and notified Black people of their freedom, it generally signified that the last segment of the roughly four million slaves in the South, now knew they were officially free,” Nafeesa Muhammad, Associate Professor of History at Spelman College, told TIME in an email. “And this is the significance of Juneteenth.”&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Galveston was a key port city at the time, making the city an important hub for business and information. “Many merchants had businesses in Galveston, so the word would spread,” says Tommie Boudreaux, Galveston Historical Foundation's Chair of African American Heritage. “It was the most important city in the state of Texas.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Read More:</strong> <a href=#>When Did Slavery Really End in the U.S.? The Complicated History of Juneteenth</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The Union Army’s arrival in Texas didn’t bring about freedom for all enslaved people—many in the “border states” of Delaware and Kentucky did not see an end to slavery until the passage of the 13th Amendment abolished it throughout the United States.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Though Juneteenth doesn’t mark the official end of slavery, it’s a day that provides an opportunity to examine and reflect on the entire history of slavery and the struggle for freedom—a struggle that continued on with the passage of Jim Crow that passed soon after the Civil War.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“There are different ways to look at freedom,” says Berry. “There were Black people that were free before June 19, 1865, free before December, 1865 [when the 13th Amendment passed], free before April 15, 1865, when the Civil War ended, and free before January 1,1863 with the issuing of the Emancipation Proclamation.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">One way many Black Americans mark the day is by <a href=#>reading aloud</a> General Order No. 3— the relatively progressive order that <a href=#>promised formerly enslaved people</a> “absolute equality of personal rights and rights of property between former masters and slaves,” and clarified the relationship between slaveholders and enslaved as one “between employer and hired labor.” In Galveston, celebrations include a massive parade, picnic, and lectures.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Juneteenth celebrations began in Texas and other Southern states as early as 1866, Berry says. Many Texans pushed for the holiday to be recognized by the state— a designation that finally came in 1980.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But where exactly did the term “Juneteenth” come from? Boudreaux says it was a Houston paper that first shortened "June 19th" to "Juneteenth" around 1890. "I just assume that it was a mouthful to say the whole thing, and apparently it stuck," she says.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Berry adds:<strong> </strong>“It went from a small regional understanding of freedom to a federal holiday [where] we now learn about the institution of slavery in this rich history of liberation and freedom.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Get alerts on the biggest breaking news stories <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZvcWhthnWAjqipop%2BZo8Buu8Vmoa6mlamyprrToWSbpJGYuG61zZ2cqZ2embKvr8Rmm5qxXZ%2FCr7GManCtoF8%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./12-people-who-decided-to-leave-their-old-self-behind-814693.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="12 People Who Decided to Leave Their Old Self Behind">&larr;
