It is a French word that translates to rebel flower. She got criticised for this tat as people claimed it was grammatically incorrect because nouns come before adjectives in the French language. However, according to the<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> <i>LA Times</i></a>, the singer elaborated that the name translates to rebel flower, two nouns, not rebellious flower.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/f24d8859cea4109b.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>20 celebrities with buffalo hump, dowager's hump or cushing's syndrome</span></p></a><h3>5.

Large cross</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/2e877b9a61c7462f.png><p class=align-left>The large cross ink is among Rihanna's arm tattoos.
