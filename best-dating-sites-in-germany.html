Parship</h3><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Parship</a>&nbsp;has been around since 2001 and claims to successfully connect people in close to 40% of cases. Their matchmaking principle is based on a comprehensive personal profile for which you answer 80 questions with hundreds of choices.</p><p>Your partnership personality is based on values, attitudes and interests relevant to your relationship. You’ll receive many suggestions for accurate matches and can make use of additional content such as dating and relationship advice or premium services and coaching.</p><p>Parship is free to use though has a limit on how many messages you can send. Premium subscriptions are available starting at €45 per month.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=Finya>2. Finya</h3><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Finya</a>&nbsp;was founded in 2001 in Hamburg. It’s one of the few dating websites which is completely free to use and will therefore show you ads.</p><p>Thanks to hundreds of thousands of profiles, Finya can offer you tailored search results and match suggestions, though you can also discover other users in a playful manner.</p><p>Contact to other members happens through messages, chat or by sending hearts. Finya has received numerous rewards throughout the years.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=Lablue>3. Lablue</h3><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Lablue</a>&nbsp;targets singles above the age of 30 and has been around since 2002. There is no fee for using the platform, which currently has around 500,000 active users.</p><p>All profiles require registration through email and are checked manually, so fake profiles are hardly an issue. The Lablue website design is a bit vanilla, but all the necessary features such as search, chat and browsing user profiles are available.</p><p>The service caters to singles looking for serious, long-term relationships instead of casual flirts or affairs.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=Lovescout24>4. Lovescout24</h3><p>The average age on&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Lovescout24</a>&nbsp;is just below 35 years. Though it’s a premium service, the platform is slightly cheaper than the competition and monthly memberships start as low as €40.</p><p>Lovescout24 boasts one million successful connections and one million active monthly users with a database of more than five million singles.</p><p>You can create a highly detailed profile and benefit from a comprehensive search feature, which delivers accurate results. You also get helpful advice, coaching and even live events organized by the platform.</p><p>In case you’ve found your match or want to leave Lovescout24 for any other reason, canceling your subscription and deleting your profile are also hassle-free. The platform uses the same design and offers the identical service as&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Neu.de</a>.</p><p><h2 class=headline>Start your 7-day free trial</h2></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=Dating-Cafe>5. Dating&nbsp;Cafe</h3><p>The service of&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Dating Cafe</a>&nbsp;has been around for more than 20 years, as you can tell by its design. Nonetheless, you can create a comprehensive profile and use excellent features to search the database of close to two million subscribers.</p><p>You can try the premium service for free, but membership starts at €15 per month. Dating Cafe targets singles around the age of 30, though you’ll definitely find users above that age as well.</p><p>You can contact others by sending a message or giving likes. Apart from the online services, Dating Cafe offers single events and vacations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=Single>6. Single</h3><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Single.de</a>&nbsp;allows you to register and keep a basic profile for free, but the premium membership starts at €25 for three months. The site claims two million German profiles and around three thousand new members daily.</p><p>You have sufficient options to create an individual profile and the extensive search is certainly helpful in finding someone matching your interests.</p><p>The platform manually checks profiles and has a personal single feed for you to browse.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=ElitePartner>7. ElitePartner</h3><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ElitePartner</a>&nbsp;specifically targets academics, so the average user age is slightly higher when compared to other platforms. The number of roughly four million members proves that EliteParnter is definitely filling the niche of dating people with a university degree or academic background.</p><p>A search on ElitePartner offers many filtering options and the suggested matches are highly accurate. You can also use their mobile app, which includes the possibility of searching for people near you. All this comes at an elite price, however: memberships start at €70 per month.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=eDarling>8. eDarling</h3><p>Similar to ElitePartner,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">eDarling</a>&nbsp;caters to singles with a high level of education. The platform is available in all of Europe with a total number of more than 13 million members, roughly three of which hail from Germany.</p><p>Upon registration, you’re presented with a comprehensive questionnaire of more than 250 questions to improve the quality of your matches.</p><p>Virtually meeting someone includes messages as well as smiles and likes. There’s also an option of seeing users who are excluded by the matching algorithm. An eDarling subscription starts at €30 per month.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=Bildkontakte>9. Bildkontakte</h3><p>Most singles rely on pictures to find a possible partner online.&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Bildkontakte</a>&nbsp;puts that feature front and center: every profile needs to be represented by an appropriate photo.</p><p>The website’s team manually checks each profile to weed out any fakes. The service boasts 50,000 daily active users and four million members.</p><p>You can contact other users after registration without having to pay, but premium features are only available with a monthly subscription starting at €10.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=Lovoo>10. Lovoo</h3><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Lovoo</a>&nbsp;allows you to register on their website, but the service primarily consists of a smartphone app for Android and iOS with in-app purchases for premium features.</p><p>Their location search is called “live radar” and shows you other users in your vicinity. The ghost mode enables you to browse profiles incognito.</p><p>Matches work by swiping left or right on user profiles, but unlike Tinder, you can contact others without having to match first. Lovoo has been around since 2011.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Find your match in these German dating sites</h2><p>Are you ready to leave the single life behind? Try these dating sites out and you might be able to find the right match for you!</p><p>And if you want to woo that special someone, keep these&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">flirty German phrases</a> in mind!</p><p><h2 class=headline>Start your 7-day free trial</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.lingoda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Jakob_02-1.jpg><h2>Jakob Straub</h2><p>Jakob is a freelance writer in Barcelona, Spain, and his favorite books have pages all empty.
